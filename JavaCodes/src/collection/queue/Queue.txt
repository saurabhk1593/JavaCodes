Queue:
1. It is used to hold multiple elements prior to processing.
2. Queue provides additional insertion, extraction, and inspection operations.
3. Queues typically, but do not necessarily, order elements in a FIFO (first-in, first-out) manner.
4. Among the exceptions are priority queues, which order elements according to a supplied comparator or the elements' natural ordering.
5. Whatever the ordering used, the head of the queue is the element that would be removed by a call to remove or poll.
6. In a FIFO queue, all new elements are inserted at the tail of the queue. Other kinds of queues may use different placement rules.
7. Every Queue implementation must specify its ordering properties.

Deque:
1. Collection used to hold multiple elements prior to processing. Besides basic Collection operations,
2. Deque provides additional insertion, extraction, and inspection operations.
3. Deques can be used both as FIFO (first-in, first-out) and LIFO (last-in, first-out).
4. In a deque all new elements can be inserted, retrieved and removed at both ends.
